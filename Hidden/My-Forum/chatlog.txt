The number π appears in many formulae across mathematics and physics. It is an irrational number, meaning that it cannot be expressed exactly as a ratio of two integers, although fractions such as  22 7 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {22}{7}}} are commonly used to approximate it. Consequently, its decimal representation never ends, nor enters a permanently repeating pattern. It is a transcendental number, meaning that it cannot be a solution of an equation involving only finite sums, products, powers, and integers. The transcendence of π implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of squaring the circle with a compass and straightedge. The decimal digits of π appear to be randomly distributed,[a] but no proof of this conjecture has been found.  For thousands of years, mathematicians have attempted to extend their understanding of π, sometimes by computing its value to a high degree of accuracy. Ancient civilizations, including the Egyptians and Babylonians, required fairly accurate approximations of π for practical computations. Around 250 BC, the Greek mathematician Archimedes created an algorithm to approximate π with arbitrary accuracy. In the 5th century AD, Chinese mathematicians approximated π to seven digits, while Indian mathematicians made a five-digit approximation, both using geometrical techniques. The first computational formula for π, based on infinite series, was discovered a millennium later.[1][2] The earliest known use of the Greek letter π to represent the ratio of a circle&#039;s circumference to its diameter was by the Welsh mathematician William Jones in 1706.[3]<br></div><div class='container py-2 px-2 border bg-lighter'><strong>mrX:</strong> Ok thanks 👍<br></div><div class='container py-2 px-2 border bg-lighter'><strong>mrX:</strong> Hooola<br></div><div class='container py-2 px-2 border bg-lighter'><strong>mrX:</strong> Holla<br></div><div class='container py-2 px-2 border bg-lighter'><strong>mrX:</strong> Holla<br></div>
